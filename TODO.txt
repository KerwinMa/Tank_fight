serik
-separate UI and control in FirstPersonControl 
[Suggestion: Add another funtion to tank.js, with the logic in firstpersoncontrols. Here no translateX or rotateX, just add to the position/rotation of the tank. Position.x/z & rotation.y]
-bullets should start from current player


-client should notify server of all moves, bullet creation
-run the game on server
-server should update the client

Bug: 
-2 scenes are still being created. 
-bug in socket.


Blackberry:
-add a lobby html file, which can be used to connect to the actual server, so that our game can be ported to blackberry bar file. 
-add controls
-can be accessed in playbook, just type url. But frame rate too low. (should be ported, should see how to)

Later
-collision between bullet and tank & between tank and tank
