-client should notify bullet creation, server should inform other client


Blackberry:
-add a lobby html file, which can be used to connect to the actual server, so that our game can be ported to blackberry bar file. 
-add controls

-can be accessed in playbook, just type url. But frame rate too low. (should be ported, should see how to) (FIXED! Needs to be tested)

Later
-collision between bullet and tank & between tank and tank
